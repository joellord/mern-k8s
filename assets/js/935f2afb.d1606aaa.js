As this is not the focus of this workshop, here is the yaml file to run it, and the associated commands.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"containerization/frontend":{"id":"containerization/frontend","title":"Containerize the frontend","description":"The backend is now running inside its own container. It\'s now time to build a container for the frontend.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"containerization/intro":{"id":"containerization/intro","title":"What are containers?","description":"Containers have existed since the 1970\'s in Unix-based operating systems. They were popularized by Docker when they released the Docker runtime in 2013. Since then, more and more developers have been using containers as part of their development process, as well as to deploy applications in a reliable way.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"containerization/network":{"id":"containerization/network","title":"Create a network","description":"In order for the containers to find each other, you will need to create a Docker network. Understanding how networking work in the containers land is out of the scope of this specific workshop. However, let\'s see how we can get our backend to connect to the MongoDB container.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deploy-to-k8s/create-ingress":{"id":"deploy-to-k8s/create-ingress","title":"Create an ingress","description":"You now have two pods running your backend service, but they aren\'t accessible from the outside of the cluster. In order for the frontend to connect to it, they will need to be exposed. This is where the ingress will come into play.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deploy-to-k8s/deploy-backend":{"id":"deploy-to-k8s/deploy-backend","title":"Deploy the backend","description":"As we did with the containers, we will start with the backend. The deployment will create two replicas of our backend.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deploy-to-k8s/deploy-database":{"id":"deploy-to-k8s/deploy-database","title":"Deploying the database on Kubernetes","description":"Deploying a database on Kubernetes is no simple task. You will need to add persistence, as well as ensuring that you have redundancy. And a your application grows, you might need to add sharding and more replication. Perhaps you will need to move data to specific geolocated servers to ensure that you GDPR policies.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deploy-to-k8s/deploy-frontend":{"id":"deploy-to-k8s/deploy-frontend","title":"Deploy the frontend","description":"The process to deploy the frontend is very similar to the backend. The two setups being almost identical.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deploy-to-k8s/intro":{"id":"deploy-to-k8s/intro","title":"What is Kubernetes?","description":"Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that can be used to manage containers in the cloud. It is commonly used in microservices architectures to ensure that all the containers are running at any given time, and that the network communication across various containers is taken care of.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deploy-to-k8s/setup-ingress":{"id":"deploy-to-k8s/setup-ingress","title":"Set up the ingress for multiple services","description":"At the moment, the ingress is only configured to access the backend.

In this example, we will use rules based on the request path to redirect the traffic to either the frontend or the backend.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"environment-setup/minikube":{"id":"environment-setup/minikube","title":"Set up Minikube","description":"The instructions for this workshop should work for any Kubernetes cluster.

It requires a lot of expertise to ensure that your deployment is future proof. In addition to that, maintaining that database can also be complex. Upgrading to more recent versions while keeping the same data can be a big issue.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introducing-atlas-operator/manage-atlas":{"id":"introducing-atlas-operator/manage-atlas","title":"Create and manage an Atlas deployment","description":"You are now ready to manage your Atlas projects and clusters from Kubernetes.

The easiest use case would be a back-end with a route to write a new database entry, and another route to retrieve all entries.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"mern-stack/intro":{"id":"mern-stack/intro","title":"What is the MERN Stack","description":"The MERN stack is a technology stack commonly used to build JavaScript application. It uses a MongoDB database, the Express framework for the back-end, the React framework on the front-end, and the server is powered by the Node.js runtime.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"mern-stack/start-backend":{"id":"mern-stack/start-backend","title":"Start the backend","description":"The first step to run everything locally is to start the back-end server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"mern-stack/start-database":{"id":"mern-stack/start-database","title":"Start a local database","description":"The recommended way to run MongoDB nowadays is by using MongoDB Atlas, the cloud offering by MongoDB. It is much easier to manage clusters through Atlas. However, in some cases, developers like to have a local instance of MongoDB running as part of their environment. This can be easier to avoid data corruption, or to enable fully offline development environments.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"mern-stack/start-frontend":{"id":"mern-stack/start-frontend","title":"Start the frontend","description":"Now that you\'ve got a database and a backend, it\'s time to start the frontend to interact with those other components in a much friendlier way.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"migrate-to-cloud/intro":{"id":"migrate-to-cloud/intro","title":"What is MongoDB Atlas","description":"So far, the focus has been on local setup. The containers were all running locally, and it was easy to use. However, there will come a point where you will most likely want to connect to a database that is shared with your colleagues. Or you will most likely want to connect to a reliable, scalable, and resilient database once you launch your application into production. This is where MongoDB Atlas will come into play.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"migrate-to-cloud/setup-backend":{"id":"migrate-to-cloud/setup-backend","title":"Set up the backend to use Atlas","description":"Now\'s the time to change your application to use the cloud database rather than the local container version.
